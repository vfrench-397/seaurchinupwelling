# Introduction

For this assignment, we used data presented in ["Examining the Role of DNA
Methylation in Transcriptomic Plasticity of Early Stage Sea Urchins: Developmental and Maternal Effects in a Kelp Forest Herbivore"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00205/full) by M. Strader et al. (2020) in Frontiers in Marine Science.

In Strader et al.â€™s work, they explored the relationship between the dynamics of gene expression and the effects of epigenetic markers. It considers the extent of environmental effects on plasticity both within and between generations of sea urchins. They worked with Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus and simulated both upwelling and non-upwelling conditions, and examined connections in changes regarding DNA methylation, transcription, and spicule length of their offspring during embryonic development.

In their analysis, they used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) sequencing, pre-processing and analysis, which is a high-throughput technique used for analysis of methylation within a genome. Following this, they used RNA sequencing as well as differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which is used for the correlation and clustering of genes.

They ultimately found that forms of genetic environmentally induced plasticity are similar within groups of genes, but on an individual level, these changes were largely unique. It also found that there were significant differences in methylation of CpG sites and gene expression based on maternal conditioning, and environmental conditions during embryonic development had a significant effect on spicule length.

# Data Analysis & Methods

First, we loaded all the required packages for our analyses.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2) 
library(affycoretools)
library(arrayQualityMetrics)
library(genefilter)
library(Biobase)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(gplots)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(tidyverse)
library(pheatmap)
```

We then set our working directory for the project.
```{r, results='hide'}
setwd("C:/Users/Maddy/Documents/BI586/seaurchinupwelling")
setwd("/usr4/bi594/vfrench3/assignment2/seaurchinupwelling")
```

Next, we read in our raw count data, and determined the length of the data. 
```{r}
countData <- read.table("geneCounts_02122019.txt")
head(countData)
length(countData[,1])
```

The length of our data is 30284. This is the number of genes we have represented in our data set.

We then remaned our data by our two treatments: NN = non-upwelling and UU = upwelling conditions.
```{r}
names(countData)=c("NN", "NN", "NN", "UU", "UU", "UU")
head(countData)
```


# Outlier Analysis

We then conducted array quality metrics to detect and remove outliers in our data. We first specified a new directory for outlier data and our treatments.
```{r, results='hide'}
setwd("C:/Users/Maddy/Documents/BI586/seaurchinupwelling/outlier")
v=setwd("C:/Users/Maddy/Documents/BI586/seaurchinupwelling/outlier")
treat=c("NN", "NN", "NN", "UU", "UU", "UU")
```

Here, we are creating colData, which is a data frame associating sample with treatment.
```{r}
g=data.frame(treat)
g
colData=g
```

We now are calling on DESeq2 to create a model for our data, which is storing the results of analysis of differential expression and asking how our design varies by treatment. We then normalized our data.
```{r}

dds=DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=countData,
                           colData = g,
                           design = ~treat)
vsd.ge=assay(vst(dds))
rl=vst(dds)
```

Using arrayQualityMetrics, we then identified any outliers in our data. An outlier in UU was detected under "Distances between arrays." We will be keeping this outlier in our data because it was only offensive in distance between arrays, but not in boxplots or MA plots. Based on the barplot of our total counts data below, we will see even distribution between our treatments, which is another reason we are keeping this outlier.

#https://scc-ondemand1.bu.edu/rnode/scc-wi3/26578/files/assignment2/seaurchinupwelling/index.html

```{r}
e=ExpressionSet(assay(rl), AnnotatedDataFrame(as.data.frame(colData(rl))))
arrayQualityMetrics(e,outdir=v,intgroup=c("treat"),force=T)
```

We then changed directories to our original directory.
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Maddy/Documents/BI586/seaurchinupwelling")
```

We then analyzed our count data by looking at the total number of counts. From this output, we can see that our raw counts range from approximately 6 million to 8 million reads across treatments. We then plotted a bar plot of the counts which shows that our raw counts are generally uniformly distributed for each treatment, which is a good signal for normalization. 
```{r}
totalCounts=colSums(countData)

totalCounts
barplot(totalCounts, col=c("coral", "coral", "coral", "red", "red", "red"), ylab="raw counts")

min(totalCounts) 
max(totalCounts)  
```

We then created the DESeq object and saved the results of the model.
```{r}
dds<-DESeq(dds)

head(dds) 
res<- results(dds)
res
```

Then, to look at the dispersion of our data, we plotted a visual representation of the DESeq object. This plot follows the general shape of a hockey stick, which shows that the dispersion fits well to the curve.
```{r}
plotDispEsts(dds, main="Dispersion plot")
```


# Treatment Comparisons

Here, we perform analyses to examine differentially expressed genes among our two treatment groups: upwelling vs. non-upwelling. In the first analysis, we specified non-upwelling (NN) as our control in the levels option and our results will therefore be in terms of upwelling compared to non-upwelling. 

We looked at signficantly differentially expressed genes in upwelling conditions at verying levels of significance. At the highest confidence level we have 715 differentially expressed genes in upwelling vs. non-upwelling conditions. 

```{r}
colData$UU<-factor(colData$treat, levels=c("UU","NN"))
resUU <- results(dds, contrast=c("treat","UU","NN"))
table(resUU$padj<0.001) 
# 0.1=3039 - not significant
# 0.05=2289
# 0.01=1344
# 0.001 =715

```

We summarized resUU. This allows us to see that there are genes removed in pairwise analysis due to low counts (23%) and we also see 5.4% of genes were downregulated in UU relative to NN. In addition, 7.2% of genes were upregulated in UU relative to NN.
```{r}
summary(resUU)
```

Here we are using another method to look at differentially expressed genes, as we did above. We see the number of significantly differentially expressed genes excluding low count genes.
```{r}
nrow(resUU[resUU$padj<0.05 & !is.na(resUU$padj),])   
```

We plotted log fold change by mean of normalized counts to produce a visual representation of differentially expressed genes. We kept the y limits to 4,-4 as anything beyond is extremely differentially expressed.  
```{r}
plotMA(resUU, main="NN vs UU") 
```

We summarized our results.
```{r}
results <- as.data.frame(resUU)
head(results)
```

Then, we examined upregulated and downregulated genes separately. Upregulated genes are genes with a positive logfold change and downregulated genes are genes with a negative logfold change.
```{r}
nrow(resUU[resUU$padj<0.1 & resUU$log2FoldChange > 0 & !is.na(resUU$padj),])
nrow(resUU[resUU$padj<0.1 & resUU$log2FoldChange < 0 & !is.na(resUU$padj),])
#UP in UU is 1735
#DOWN in UU is 1304
```

We created a table to summarize our results from above. 
```{r}
write.table(resUU, file="UU_DEG.txt", quote=F, sep="\t") 

cd <- read.table("UU_DEG.txt")
cd

```

We created a GO table with ranked p-values with directionality for each gene. We then saved the table as a CSV for future GO analysis.
```{r}
cd
go_input_UU = cd %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "iso") %>%
  mutate(mutated_p = -log(pvalue)) %>%
  mutate(mutated_p_updown = ifelse(log2FoldChange < 0, mutated_p*-1, mutated_p*1)) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  select(iso, mutated_p_updown)

head(go_input_UU)
colnames(go_input_UU) <- c("gene", "pval")
head(go_input_UU)
write.csv(go_input_UU, file="UU_GO.csv", quote=F, row.names=FALSE)

```

We bound the p-value from res comparisons and the p-adjusted values. We then created a log fold change p-value data table.
```{r}
valUU=cbind(resUU$pvalue, resUU$padj)
head(valUU)
#this is pvalues and padjusted values
colnames(valUU)=c("pval.UU", "padj.UU")
length(valUU[,1]) #this is the number of genes we are looking at = 30284 (same as above)
table(complete.cases(valUU))
#False = NAs
```


Here we are performing r log transformations, which is a normalization method and important for making heat maps and PCAs. 
```{r}
rlog=rlogTransformation(dds, blind=TRUE) 
rld=assay(rlog)
head(rld)
#this shows us for each isogroup, the r log normalized values for each of our samples
colnames(rld)=paste(colData$treat)
head(rld)
length(rld[,1]) #length should be still same, indicating retention of all data
```

Now we are binding our rld data and p-values in order to rank p-values for the top 100 heat map we create later on. We then created a CSV file with this information.
```{r}
rldpvals=cbind(rld,valUU)
head(rldpvals)
dim(rldpvals) #looking at dimensions [1] 30284     
table(complete.cases(rldpvals))
#FALSE  TRUE 
#11745  18539 , sanity check: we still have the same number of NAs (false) here

write.csv(rldpvals, "RLDandPVALS.csv", quote=F)


```

Then we created our Sample Distance heat map. Our heat map shows clustering of similar samples by upwelling and non-upwelling conditions, which we expect. This is a good way to visualize overall expression between our samples.
```{r}
rldpvals <- read.csv(file="RLDandPVALS.csv", row.names=1)
head(rldpvals)
rld=rldpvals[,1:6] 
#making rld which is just columns 1-6 and will cut off p-values to just leave us with r log normalized isogroups
head(rld)

sampleDists <- dist(t(rld))
sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix( sampleDists )
treat=c( "upwelling", "upwelling", "upwelling", "non-upwelling", "non-upwelling", "non-upwelling")
colnames(sampleDistMatrix)=paste(treat)
rownames(sampleDistMatrix)=paste(treat)

#creating a heat map from the sampledistMatrix 
heat.colors = colorRampPalette(rev(c("navy","beige")),bias=0.3)(100)
pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,color = heat.colors,cex=0.9,border_color=NA,cluster_rows=T,cluster_cols=T)

```

# Principal Component Analysis 

We then performed a principle components analysis (PCA). We first transposed our data frame and then removed columns within the dataframe with zero variance, meaning they were not diferentially expressed genes.
```{r}
rld_t=t(rld) 

which(apply(rld_t, 2, var)==0)
rld_t <- rld_t[ , which(apply(rld_t, 2, var) != 0)]
```

We then created the PCA figure with ggplot. We are interested in PC1 and PC2 because these are the two principle components that explain the most variance in our samples. 
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(rld_t,center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE) #up to 6 principle components because n=6 samples 
head(pca)


#defining amount of variance described by PC1 and PC2 
li <- pca$sdev^2 / sum(pca$sdev^2)
pc1v <- round(li[1] * 100, 1)
pc2v <- round(li[2] * 100, 1)
pca_s <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
head(pca_s)
pca_s <- pca_s[,c(1,2)] #pulling out first two PCs
pca_s$Samples = row.names(pca_s)
pca_s$treat=colData$treat
head(pca_s)

#Plotting pca with ggplot
cbPalette <- c("darkgoldenrod2",  "darkolivegreen3", "dodgerblue3")
ggplot(pca_s, aes(PC1, PC2, color = treat, pch = treat)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  #  geom_text_repel(aes(label=Samples)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbPalette)+
  theme_bw() +
  # geom_density2d(alpha=.5)+
  geom_polygon(alpha=.2)+
  xlab(paste0("PC1: ",pc1v,"% variance")) +
  ylab(paste0("PC2: ",pc2v,"% variance")) 
head(pca)
```


# Statistical Analysis ############## Double check this significance; it was significant when first ran and now isn't?  #########

We performed an ANOVA analysis to test if distances between samples on our PCA are significantly different. We see that ________
```{r}
adonis(pca$x ~ treat, data = pca_s, method='eu', na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Heatmap

Here we are creating a heatmap for top 100 most significant differentially expressed genes.
```{r}
rldpvals <- read.csv(file="RLDandPVALS.csv", row.names=1)
head(rldpvals)
rld_site= rldpvals[,1:6] 
head(rld_site)
gg=read.table("goAnnot_spu.tab",sep="\t", row.names=1)
head(gg)

nrow(rldpvals[rldpvals$padj.UU<0.01& !is.na(rldpvals$padj.UU),])
```
We see here that 1344 isogroups are extremely differentially expressed at a p-adjusted value <0.01.

We ranked p-adjusted values to find the top 100 most differentially expressed genes.
```{r}
topnum= 100 # number of DEGS in final heatmap 
head(rldpvals)
top100=head(rldpvals[order(rldpvals$padj.UU), ],topnum)
head(top100)
length(top100[,1])
summary(top100)


head(top100)
p.val=0.1 # FDR cutoff
conds=top100[top100$padj.UU<=p.val & !is.na(top100$padj.UU),] #all top 100 where the p- adjusted value is less than or equal to .1 (significant)
length(conds[,1])

exp=conds[,1:6] #removing associated p-values from log fold change data
means=apply(exp,1,mean) # means of rows
explc=exp-means # subtracting them
colnames(explc)=c("NN1", "NN2", "NN3", "UU1", "UU2", "UU3")
head(explc)

ccol=colorRampPalette(rev(c("red","chocolate1","#FEE090","grey10", "cyan3","cyan")))(100)
col0=colorRampPalette(rev(c("chocolate1","#FEE090","grey10", "cyan3","cyan")))(100)

pheatmap(explc,cluster_cols=T,scale="row",color=col0, show_rownames = F)
```

We then added gene annotation to top 100 heatmap 
```{r}
ann = data.frame(cond = c('UU', 'UU', 'UU', 'NN', 'NN', 'NN'))
rownames(ann) <- names(explc)

# Set colors
Var1        <- c("purple",  "Navy", "Lavender")
names(Var1) <- c("UU", "NN")
anno_colors <- list(cond = Var1)

pheatmap(as.matrix(explc),annotation_col=ann,annotation_colors=anno_colors,cex=.85,color=col0,border_color=NA,clustering_distance_rows="correlation",clustering_distance_cols="correlation", show_rownames=T)
```

# GO Analysis 


```{r}
#Assigning variables for gomwuStats arguments
input="UU_GO.csv" #isogroup with corresponding p-value 
goAnnotations="goAnnot_spu.tab" 
goDatabase="go-basic.obo"
source("gomwu.functions.R") #reading in code for functions needed to enact GO analysis 
```

#GO Stats 

First we find that under Biological Process, 30 categories dropped because they were too broadly expressed to be considered enriched, 961 were too small so we are left with a remainder of 837. 409 of those were not redundant and 69 were left after secondary clustering at a 10% False Discovery Rate. 

```{r}
#GO terms under Biological Process 

goDivision.BP="BP" #change and run GO for each major functional group (BP, MF, CC)

gomwuStats(input, goDatabase, goAnnotations, goDivision.BP, perlPath = "perl",
           largest=0.1, # setting maximum proportion of total genes before GO terms not represented
           smallest=5, # setting minimum number of different genes needed under a GO term to be represented 
           clusterCutHeight=0.25 #setting specificity of represented GO terms #Increase for more specificity #decrease for more general umbrella terms)
)
#Largest and smallest set to define reasonable levels of enrichment

```

Under Cellular component we see 12 categories dropped for being too broad, 234 too small with a remaining 173. 118 were non-redundant and we are left with 29 significant after secondary clustering

```{r}
#GO terms under Cellular Component

goDivision.CC="CC" #change and run GO for each major functional group (BP, MF, CC)

gomwuStats(input, goDatabase, goAnnotations, goDivision.CC, perlPath = "perl", largest=0.1, smallest=5, clusterCutHeight=0.25)
```

21 too broad, 721 too small, remaining 545. 391 non-redundant with 69 after secondary clustering. 
```{r}
#GO terms under Molecular Function 

goDivision.MF="MF" #change and run GO for each major functional group (BP, MF, CC)

#Conclusion 

Overall, our results were for the most part consistent with those described in the original research. We can see some changes in differential expression in regards to a few particular groups of genes in response to the environmental stressors (pH and temperature in this case), similar to the findings of the study. The GO analysis shows data that suggests the stress response of the urchins is shown in its gene expression, such as the reduced expression of signaling in the molecular function section and the changes in RNA modifications and processing in the biological process section, which was what was found in the original paper as well. This provides some evidence for the concept that environmental conditions can induce changes in gene expression, most strongly shown by the maternal conditioning group's data.
